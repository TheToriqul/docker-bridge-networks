## 📋 Project Overview

As a passionate learner and technology enthusiast, I embarked on a journey to unravel the mysteries of Docker bridge networks. This project represents my hands-on exploration of creating custom bridge networks, attaching containers to multiple networks, and leveraging powerful tools like `ip` and `nmap` to examine network configurations and discover other containers.

Through this project, I aimed to gain a deep understanding of Docker networking concepts and develop the skills necessary to design and manage complex network architectures in containerized environments. By sharing my findings and experiences, I hope to inspire others to dive into the fascinating world of Docker networking and empower them to build robust and secure containerized applications.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience with creating and configuring custom bridge networks in Docker
- Understand the benefits and use cases of attaching containers to multiple networks
- Master the usage of `ip` command for examining network interfaces and IP addresses
- Explore the capabilities of `nmap` for network scanning and container discovery
- Develop a strong foundation in Docker networking concepts and best practices

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project implements a multi-layered network architecture utilizing Docker's native networking capabilities and custom bridge networks.

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚙️ Installation</summary>

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TheToriqul/docker-bridge-networks.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd docker-bridge-networks
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎮 Usage</summary>

1. Create custom bridge networks:
   ```
   docker network create --driver bridge user-network
   docker network create --driver bridge user-network2
   ```

2. Launch containers and attach them to networks:
   ```
   docker run -dit --name container1 --network user-network alpine:latest
   docker run -dit --name container2 --network user-network alpine:latest
   docker run -dit --name container3 --network user-network2 alpine:latest
   docker run -dit --name container4 --network user-network2 alpine:latest
   ```

3. Connect containers to additional networks:
   ```
   docker network connect user-network2 container1
   ```

4. Examine network interfaces and IP addresses:
   ```
   docker exec -it container1 ip addr
   ```

5. Install and use `nmap` for network scanning:
   ```
   docker exec -it container1 apk add --no-cache nmap
   docker exec -it container1 nmap -sn 172.18.0.0/16
   ```
